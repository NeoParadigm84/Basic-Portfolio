      <p>“Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.” – Helen Keller</p>
    
      <p>I was born on the 31st day of March sometime in the 80s. It was an unseasonably warm spring day when I was born. My parents were young and ambitious and had already made plans to work and live overseas. By the time I was a year I took my first plane ride from Washington, DC to Freetown Serra Leon. I would spend the next 18 years of my life traveling from one country to another eventually living on all contents except for the artic poles. I had been exposed to countless religions and cultures before I was even a teenager. I had walked miles of the great wall while my peers in the US were getting ready for their first middle school dance. My first kiss was under a baobab tree on a safari in South Africa. By the time I was ready for college I had quiet literally seen the world. This lifestyle significantly shaped my world view and personality. It has made me question everything and simultaneously accept alternate perspectives. It has made me unafraid of trying new things. </p>

      <p>After spending a lifetime overseas, I decided to spend my college years in a country I was born in but had never lived in, the United States of America. I attended Morehouse College in Atlanta Georgia where I received a degree in Political Science and a minor in French. I continued my education at American University obtaining a Masters in Conflict Resolution. I developed a passion for many things during my college years but have always been drawn to the ever-evolving world of computer science. I have set my sights on mastering the world of web development.</p>
